# Deep-Learning-Implementation
numpy code to illustrate fundamental things on deep learning 

> deep learning from scratch: cnn and rnn 
> distributed learning from scratch: spark as parameter server (Synchronous SGD)
> word embedding from scratch: skip-gram and cbow

> little bit tensorflow code for comparision and sanity check!
